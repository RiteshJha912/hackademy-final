          <p>
            Buzzing WhatsApp groups promise "insider" stock tips for quick
            riches, but they're traps run by fraudsters posing as experts. They
            lure you with free advice, then push fake apps or schemes where your
            investments vanish. Seniors eyeing easy gains are easy prey in
            India, where trading hype is huge. Many victims only realize they've
            been scammed when trying to withdraw money or when the admin
            suddenly disappears. These scams exploit trust and the fear of
            missing out on high returns, making it crucial to stay cautious.

            A 70 year-old from Kolshet, Thane, lost â‚¹2 crore after joining a
            WhatsApp group promising stock tips. The admin, posing as a Chicago
            investment firm rep, lured him with fake high return trades. He
            invested, saw false profits, but withdrawal demands exposed the
            scam.
